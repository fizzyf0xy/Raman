## Review literature

As part of my thesis, I will conduct an experiment to measure glucose concentrations in blood using Raman Spectroscopy.
Please see the table below for a summary of all the sources I read.


# 1. Rapid, Sensitive and Selective Optical Glucose Sensing with Stimulated Raman Scattering (SRS)
|Title|Rapid, Sensitive and Selective Optical Glucose Sensing with Stimulated Raman Scattering (SRS)|
|------|-----|
|Year|2022|
|Preparation|1. Calibration curve: D-(+)-glucose powder ($C_6H_{12}O_6$ , purity ≥ 99.5%) with nanopure water (concentrations of 75, 50, 25, 10, 5, and 2.5 $mol/m^3$) |
|      |2. Sample: Human serum solution (male AB plasma, sterile-filtered, stored in 253K)|
|Instrument|1. The stimulated Raman spectra were obtained by direct transmission confocal microscope (Leica TCS SP8, Leica Microsystems, Germany) |
|      |2. The Stokes beam wavelength was fixed at 1031.2 nm, and the Pump beam was tuned from 918 to 937 nm, allowing the excitation of vibrations in the range from 975 to 1200 $cm^{–1}$. |
|Method|SRS enhances the Raman effect by stimulating excitation, leading to improved sensitivity and selectivity in optical glucose sensing.|
|Preprocessing|1. Baseline correction: Asymmetric least-square fit|
|      |2. Smoothing: Savitzky-Golay filter|
|Results|linear calibration curve for glucose concentrations from 2.5 to 100 $mol/m^3$ (mmol/l) with a theoretical limit of detection (LOD) of 3.5 $mol/m^3$ ($R^2$ value of 0.99.)|
