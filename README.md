# Measuring Blood concentration in `water` and `blood` using Raman Spectroscopy

This repository is a master's thesis and is a part of https://github.com/akraradets/Measure-Blood-Glucose-with-Raman.
The ultimate objective is to measure Glycemic (glucose concentration in blood) in a non-invasive manner.
Thus, we start a proof of concept/preliminary study on this research question "Can Raman spectroscopy measure glucose concentration in a solution?"

## Objective

We want to know that (1) Raman can assess the concentration of Glucose in `water` and (2) Raman can assess the concentration of Glucose in `blood`.

## How to use this repository?

This repository is mostly documentation.
