# Experiment design

For measuring glucose concentration in blood by Raman Spectroscopy, we need to ensure that our instruments are into proper condition and they can measure the results correctly.

The experiment design are divided as two sections below

1. Glucose concentration in water (distilled water)
2. Glucose concentration in blood 


## 1. Glucose concentration in water
This experimant design is based on the paper name Rapid, Sensitive and Selective Optical Glucose Sensing with Stimulated Raman Scattering (SRS)

**Glucose concentration preparation**
  Reference concentration: 75, 50, 25, 10, 5, 2.5 $mol/m^3$

  Converted reference concentration: 13.5 ,9 ,4.5 , 1.8, 0.9 ,0.45 mg/ml

**Preparation**
1) 13.5 mg/ml :  **We prepare the maximum concentration first**
weigh glucose 0.135 g. in 13.5 ml of distilled water
2) 9 mg/ml : Take 6 ml from the first stock, and dilute with diluent to a final volume of exactly 9 mL
3) 4.5 mg/ml : Take 5 ml from the first stock, and dilute with diluent to a final volume of exactly 10 mL
4) 1.8 mg/ml : Take 4 ml from the first stock, and dilute with diluent to a final volume of exactly 10 mL
5) 0.9 mg/ml : Take 5 ml from the first stock, and dilute with diluent to a final volume of exactly 10 mL
6) 0.45 mg/ml : Take 5 ml from the first stock, and dilute with diluent to a final volume of exactly 10 mL

We measure each concentration by our instrument but it's not same as actual condition of the reference paper,

They recorded a linear calibration curve for glucose concentrations below 100 mol/m^3 with a theoretical limit of detection (LOD) of 3.5 $mol/m^3$ in a 0.6 s integration time.
